Title: Visualize Stylometric Data with ggplot2
Version: 0.3.0
Author: James M. Clawson
Maintainer: James M. Clawson <clawson@gmail.com>
Description: Import data from stylo() and visualize it with different
    settings, removing the need to reevaluate for new visualizations.
    Stylo2gg provides reasonable defaults to recreate most Stylo 
    visualizations, but it also provides methods to highlight subsets
    of the data and to provide visualizations well suited for printing
    without color.
